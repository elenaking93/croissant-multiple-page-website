    <h1>The history of the croissant 🥐</h1>
    <p>
      You’ve probably already read elsewhere the shocking news: croissants
      weren’t invented in France. (Ok, you’re probably just curious about the
      factoid, but never mind). As with every aspect of tracing the croissant’s
      tortuous history, however, it’s actually a bit more complicated than that.
      Most food historians trace the origins of the croissant to Austria and
      elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where small pastries called kipferl had been
      made since at least the 13th century, according to numerous records.
